            A paragraph is a collection of related sentences 
            dealing with a single topic. Learning to write good paragraphs will help you 
            as a writer stay on track during your drafting and revision stages. Good
            paragraphing also greatly assists your readers in following a piece
            of writing. You can have fantastic ideas, but if those ideas aren't 
            presented in an organized fashion, you will lose your readers
            (and fail to achieve your goals in writing).
